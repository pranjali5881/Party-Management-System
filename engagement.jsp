5. Decide who’s hosting.

Traditionally, the bride’s parents host the engagement party—but that’s not a hard-and-fast rule.
 Whether it’s you and your fiancé, your siblings, your BFF, or your partner’s family, 
 just about anyone can plan (and pay for) the celebration. 
 Of course, the bride’s parents should still have the first right of refusal,
  so if someone is offering to throw an engagement party for you, run it by Mom and Dad first.
   And remember: You don’t have to have an engagement party at all, or you can have a few 
   (which is quite common if you and your S.O.are from different places or 
   live far from home and want to have a party with friends too).

6. Send invitations.
The type of invitations you choose will depend on the type of event you’re throwing. 
If you have a little time and are hosting a seated dinner, paper invitations are an elegant option.
 Going more casual? Opt for an e-vite with a playful theme. 
 The great thing about e-vites is that the design options are endless, so if you’re on a budget, 
 you can definitely choose a formal design and email invitations to a fancier engagement party, too. 
 (Just don’t email your wedding invitations and you’re golden!) And good news: 
 There’s no need to match these invitations to the rest of your wedding stationery, 
 so pick something festive that you love
