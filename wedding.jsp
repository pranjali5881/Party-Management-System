1.Finalize your location, date and time for your event. 
These are some of the most important things that you must finalize before hiring a catering company.<br>
 Sometimes, a catering service may be available on site. <br>
 This is good because they will be very familiar with the ground, layout and coordination.<br>
 If you are bringing in a catering company, make sure that they are briefed on the location, date and time of your event.<br> 
</p>

<p>
2.Set your budget for catering service.
 Before you set the budget for catering, you need to ask yourself how important the roles of food and
 drink will play at your event. How many guests are you inviting to your event?
 Are you having a buffet or a sit-down dinner?
 Do you need to have a theme or style for your event that will be reflected in the food that you served?
 All these are some questions that you need to clarify first.
 Sometimes the cost of the catering service also depends on the caterer's level of expertise and reputation. 
</p>


3.Find out whether they provide catering staffs. 
Some catering service will provide staffs and servers.
 Find out from them how many staffs they are providing for your event. 
 A general rule of thumb is to have 1 server for every 10 guests.
 You can also request the dress code of the staffs in accordance with the dress attire of your guests and 
 the theme of your event.

<p>
4.Find out whether they provide full event planning support.
 Other than food catering, some catering company offers full event planning which includes decorations and 
 event layout arrangement. 
 Check with your caterer to see if they provide a full service.
 So if you are planning an event, it is always good to have a catering company to assist you.
  They will lessen your work load and together with you, they will help make the event as successful as possible. <br>
